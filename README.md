## ⚙️ Technology Stack

This project leverages modern technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance. Below is an overview of the stack and the purpose of each technology:

🔹 Backend

Django → A high-level Python web framework used to build robust and scalable backend services. It provides built-in tools for authentication, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), and RESTful API development.

GraphQL → A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Used for efficient communication between the frontend and backend.

🔹 Database

PostgreSQL → A powerful open-source relational database. It is used to store structured project data such as users, properties, bookings, and transactions.

🔹 Frontend

React → A JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces. It powers the frontend experience and ensures responsive, interactive pages.

TailwindCSS → A utility-first CSS framework used to quickly design responsive and modern UI components.

🔹 DevOps & Infrastructure

Docker → Containerization tool to package applications with all dependencies, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

NGINX → A high-performance web server used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to handle client requests efficiently.

GitHub Actions → CI/CD tool used to automate testing, building, and deployment pipelines.

🔹 Testing & Quality Assurance

PyTest → A testing framework for Python used to write unit and integration tests for backend logic.

Jest → A testing framework for JavaScript/React applications to ensure UI components and logic work as expected.

🔹 Deployment & Hosting

AWS (Amazon Web Services) → Provides cloud infrastructure for hosting the application (EC2 for compute, S3 for storage, RDS for PostgreSQL database).

Vercel/Netlify → Used for deploying and hosting the frontend React application.

created_at

👉 Each payment is tied to a specific booking.

Entity Relationships

A User (Host) → can own multiple Properties.

A User (Guest) → can make multiple Bookings.

A Property → can have multiple Bookings and Reviews.

A Booking → is associated with one Property and one Guest.

A Booking → has one Payment.

A Review → belongs to one Property and one Guest.

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management  
Users can create accounts, update their profiles, and securely log in or out of the platform. This feature ensures personalized experiences, such as saving favorite listings, managing bookings, and hosting properties.  

### 2. Property Management  
Hosts can list properties with details such as description, location, price, and amenities. They can also update or remove listings, making it easy to manage multiple properties from one dashboard.  

### 3. Booking System  
Guests can book available properties by selecting dates, confirming availability, and completing reservations. This feature includes handling conflicts (e.g., overlapping bookings) and sending booking confirmations.  

### 4. Payment Processing  
Integrated payment gateways allow guests to pay securely for bookings. This ensures smooth transactions between guests and hosts while keeping financial data secure.  

### 5. Review & Rating System  
Guests can leave reviews and ratings after completing a stay, and hosts can respond. This feature builds trust and transparency on the platform, helping users make informed booking decisions.  

### 6. Search & Filtering  
Guests can search for properties based on location, price range, property type, and amenities. Filtering makes it easier to find suitable options quickly.  

### 7. Notifications & Alerts  
Users receive notifications for important actions, such as booking confirmations, payment receipts, and review updates. This feature enhances user engagement and ensures they don’t miss critical updates.  

### 8. Admin Dashboard  
Admins can oversee platform activity, including managing users, monitoring bookings, and handling disputes. This ensures the system remains fair, reliable, and well-governed.  
## API Security

Ensuring the security of backend APIs is critical in an application like an Airbnb Clone, where sensitive data (user details, payments, bookings) is processed. The following security measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication**: All endpoints will be protected using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). This ensures that only verified users can access protected resources such as creating bookings or making payments.  
  *Importance*: Protects user accounts and prevents unauthorized access.

- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced so that users can only perform actions they are permitted to (e.g., only property owners can edit their listings).  
  *Importance*: Prevents malicious or accidental actions from users without sufficient privileges.

- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse and brute-force attacks, APIs will implement request rate limiting per user or IP.  
  *Importance*: Protects against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and improves system stability.

- **Data Validation & Sanitization**: All inputs will be validated using strict schemas to prevent injection attacks.  
  *Importance*: Ensures system reliability and defends against SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.

- **Secure Payments**: Payment endpoints will use HTTPS and integrate with secure payment gateways to handle financial data safely.  
  *Importance*: Protects sensitive financial details and ensures compliance with security standards.
