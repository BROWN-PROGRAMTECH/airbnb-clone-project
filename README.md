## ⚙️ Technology Stack

This project leverages modern technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance. Below is an overview of the stack and the purpose of each technology:

🔹 Backend

Django → A high-level Python web framework used to build robust and scalable backend services. It provides built-in tools for authentication, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), and RESTful API development.

GraphQL → A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Used for efficient communication between the frontend and backend.

🔹 Database

PostgreSQL → A powerful open-source relational database. It is used to store structured project data such as users, properties, bookings, and transactions.

🔹 Frontend

React → A JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces. It powers the frontend experience and ensures responsive, interactive pages.

TailwindCSS → A utility-first CSS framework used to quickly design responsive and modern UI components.

🔹 DevOps & Infrastructure

Docker → Containerization tool to package applications with all dependencies, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

NGINX → A high-performance web server used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to handle client requests efficiently.

GitHub Actions → CI/CD tool used to automate testing, building, and deployment pipelines.

🔹 Testing & Quality Assurance

PyTest → A testing framework for Python used to write unit and integration tests for backend logic.

Jest → A testing framework for JavaScript/React applications to ensure UI components and logic work as expected.

🔹 Deployment & Hosting

AWS (Amazon Web Services) → Provides cloud infrastructure for hosting the application (EC2 for compute, S3 for storage, RDS for PostgreSQL database).

Vercel/Netlify → Used for deploying and hosting the frontend React application.
